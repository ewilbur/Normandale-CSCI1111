 * @description First program written for CSCI 1111. This is copied verbatim 
 *              from the textbook. Apparently, the purpose of this program is
 *              only test to see if we can compile the program? Well, it
 *              compiled. Removed the comments from the original because they
 *              seemed a bit unnecessary.
